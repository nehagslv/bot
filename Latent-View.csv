"Internal Risk Factors"
"1.   Historically, we have entered into long-term partnerships with a few of our key clients, which has resulted in a limited"
"number of clients accounting for a substantial portion of our revenue. If our existing clients do not renew their contracts"
"with us, or expand the scope of services we provide to them, or if our long-term relationships with our largest clients"
"are impaired or terminated, our revenue could decline, and our results of operations would be adversely impacted."
""
"We derive a significant portion of our revenue from existing clients in the form of long-term arrangements, and increasing the"
"scope and type of service we provide to our existing clients is a major part of our growth strategy. Revenue from operations"
"from our top five clients together represented 54.00%, 53.69% and 54.66% of our revenue from operations in Fiscals 2021,"
"2020 and 2019, respectively. Certain of our clients, including certain of our top 10 clients by revenue in the last three Fiscals,"
"have reduced their spend with us or terminated their agreements with us, which has reduced our anticipated future payments or"
"revenue from these clients. For instance, six of our clients who were among the top 10 clients in Fiscal 2019 have reduced their"
"spend with us, and as a result, are not among our top 10 clients in Fiscal 2021. Revenue from operations from these clients"
"decreased by 12.50% from ₹ 2,144.57 million in Fiscal 2019 to ₹ 1,876.39 million in Fiscal 2021. It is not possible for us to"
"predict the future level of demand from our larger clients for our services."
""
"Our clients typically have no obligation to renew or expand their agreements with us after the terms of their existing agreements"
"have expired. For information on the terms of our agreements, see “Our Business – Our Business Operations – Contracting"
"20"
"and Delivery Model” on page 139. If one or more of our clients terminate their contracts with us, whether for convenience, for"
"default in the event of a breach by us, or for other reasons specified in our contracts, as applicable, our business and results of"
"operations could be adversely affected. This adverse impact would be even more pronounced for clients that represent a material"
"portion of our revenue or business operations."
""
"Our ability to renew or expand our client relationships may decrease or vary as a result of a number of factors, including our"
"clients’ satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our services, reliability of our digital solutions, our pricing, the effects of general"
"economic conditions, competitive offerings or alternatives, or reductions in our clients’ spending levels. If our clients do not"
"renew or expand their agreements with us or if they renew their contracts for shorter lengths or on other terms less favorable to"
"us, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline, and our business could suffer. Our business, financial"
"condition, and results of operations would also be adversely affected if we face difficulty collecting our accounts receivable"
"from our clients. In addition, our clients’ decisions to expand the scope of services we offer to them depends on a number of"
"factors, including general economic conditions, quality and accuracy of our solutions, our ability to assist our clients in"
"appropriately identifying challenges faced, mapping out a feasible framework, achieving success with data-driven initiatives,"
"and our clients’ satisfaction with our solutions. If our efforts to expand within our existing client base are not successful, our"
"business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted."
""
"2.   The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations is uncertain and it may be significant"
"and continue to have an adverse effect on our business, operations and our future financial performance."
""
"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and its continuing impact, as well as government measures to reduce the spread of"
"COVID-19, have had a substantial impact on our operations across India and abroad since last week of March 2020. The impact"
"of the pandemic on our business, operations and future financial performance have included and may in the future include the"
"following:"
""
"•   Temporary closure of our offices worldwide and virtualizing, postponing, or canceling client, employee, or industry"
"events, which may negatively impact our business."
""
"•   Disruptions in the operations of our clients and prospective clients, including as a result of travel restrictions and/or"
"business shutdowns, uncertainty in the financial markets or other harm to their business and financial results, leading"
"to reduction in information technology budgets, delayed purchasing decisions, longer sales cycles, extended payment"
"terms, the timing of payments, and postponed or canceled projects, all of which may negatively impact our business"
"and operating results, including sales and cash flows. As a result of decline in new mandates from clients, revenue"
"from operations decreased by 1.44% from ₹ 3,103.57 million in Fiscal 2020 to ₹ 3,058.79 million in Fiscal 2021. In"
"comparison, revenue from operations increased by 7.79% from ₹ 2,879.34 million in Fiscal 2019 to ₹ 3,103.57 million"
"in Fiscal 2020."
""
"•   Carrying out field sales and professional services activities remotely, as compared to conducting them in person."
"Currently, as a result of the work and travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the precautionary"
"measures that we have adopted, substantially all of our field sales and professional services activities are being"
"conducted remotely, which has resulted in a decrease in our travelling and conveyance expenses that decreased by"
"60.82% from ₹ 113.57 million in Fiscal 2020 to ₹ 44.50 million in Fiscal 2021. However, we expect our travel"
"expenditures to increase in the future, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations."
"We do not yet know the extent of the negative impact of such restrictions and precautionary measures on our ability"
"to attract new clients or retain and expand our relationships with existing clients."
""
"•   Remote working arrangements for our employees, which may have a negative impact on our operations; the execution"
"of our business plans; our ability to recruit, train, manage, and retain employees; the productivity and availability of"
"key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business; and on third-party service providers who"
"perform critical services for us, or otherwise cause operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices"
"necessitated by the outbreak and related governmental actions. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue,"
"or other event occurred that impacted our employees’ ability to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases,"
"impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote working may also"
"result in increased consumer privacy, data security, and fraud risks, and our understanding of applicable legal and"
"regulatory requirements, as well as the latest guidance from regulatory authorities in connection with the COVID-"
"19 pandemic, may be subject to legal or regulatory challenge, particularly as regulatory guidance evolves in response"
"to future developments."
""
"More generally, the COVID-19 pandemic has and is expected to continue to adversely affect economies and financial markets"
"globally, leading to a continued economic downturn, which may decrease technology spending generally and could adversely"
"affect demand for our services. It is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our business,"
"21"
"as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted such as new information"
"which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus, spread of new strains of the coronavirus, the scope and duration"
"of the pandemic, any recovery period, future actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, the effects"
"on our clients, counterparties, employees and third-party service providers, the actions taken globally to contain the coronavirus"
"or treat its impact, among others. As a result of these uncertainties, the impact may vary significantly from that estimated by"
"our management from time to time, and any action to contain or mitigate such impact, whether government-mandated or opted"
"by us may not have the anticipated effect or may fail to achieve its intended purpose altogether. In addition, while vaccination"
"processes have been initiated globally, achieving a complete vaccination scale may take significant amount of time and"
"accordingly, normalcy of businesses may also take a significant amount of time. Although we continue to monitor the situation"
"and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance become available, the ongoing effects of"
"the COVID-19 pandemic and/or the precautionary measures that we have adopted may create operational and other challenges,"
"any of which could harm our business and results of operations."
""
"Moreover, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, and results of operations,"
"it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, including but not"
"limited to, those related to our ability to increase sales to existing and new clients, continue to perform on existing contracts,"
"expand our marketing capabilities and sales organization, generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness, and comply"
"with the covenants in the agreements that govern our indebtedness."
""
"3.   We derive a significant portion of our revenues from clients located in the United States and any adverse developments"
"in this market could adversely affect our business."
"We have historically derived a significant portion of our revenues from operations from clients located in the United States of"
"America. Revenue from operations from the United States of America amounted to ₹ 2,841.12 million, ₹ 2,865.63 million, and"
"₹ 2,617.51 million, in Fiscals 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and represented 92.88%, 92.33%, and 90.91%, of our revenue"
"from operations, in such periods, respectively. Our revenues from the United States may decline as a result of increased"
"competition, regulatory action, pricing pressures, fluctuations in the demand for or supply of our services, or the outbreak of an"
"infectious disease such as COVID-19. Our failure to effectively react to these situations or to successfully introduce new"
"services could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Further, international"
"operations are subject to risks that are specific to each country and region in which we operate, as well as risks associated with"
"international operations, in general. These risks include complying with changes in foreign laws, regulations and policies,"
"including restrictions on trade, import and export license requirements, and tariffs and taxes, intellectual property enforcement"
"issues and changes in foreign trade and investment policies."
""
"4.   Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations as some portion of our revenues and a"
"significant portion of our expenditures are denominated in foreign currencies."
""
"We are exposed to foreign exchange related risks as a portion of our revenue from operations are in foreign currency, including"
"the US Dollar. In Fiscals 2021, 2020 and 2019, revenue from operations outside India represented 96.17%, 97.48%, and 99.59%,"
"respectively, of our total revenue from operations in such periods. While we make provisions for foreign exchange fluctuations,"
"ensure that the transactions at the foreign subsidiaries are in their functional currency to create a natural hedge and also take"
"steps to hedge our foreign currency fluctuation risk for transactions entered in foreign currency in India, a significant or frequent"
"fluctuation in the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and other currencies, may adversely affect our results of operations."
"The exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and foreign currencies, primarily the USD, has fluctuated in the past and our"
"results of operations have been impacted by such fluctuations in the past and may be impacted by such fluctuations in the future."
"For example, during times of strengthening of the Indian Rupee, we expect that our revenue from offerings overseas will"
"generally be negatively impacted as foreign currency received will be translated into fewer Indian Rupees. However, the"
"converse positive effect of depreciation in the Indian Rupee may not be sustained or may not show an appreciable impact in"
"our results of operations in any given financial period due to other variables impacting our business and results of operations"
"during the same period. Accordingly, any appreciation or depreciation of the Indian Rupee against these currencies can impact"
"our results of operations. We may from time to time be required to make provisions for foreign exchange differences in"
"accordance with accounting standards."
""
"Our ability to foresee future foreign currency fluctuations is limited and due to the time gap between the accounting of purchases"
"and actual payments, the foreign exchange rate at which the purchase is recorded in the books of accounts may vary with the"
"foreign exchange rate at which the payment is made, thereby benefiting or affecting us negatively, depending on the appreciation"
"or depreciation of the Rupee. We may, therefore, be exposed to risks arising from exchange rate fluctuations and we may not"
"be able to pass on all losses on account of foreign currency fluctuations to our clients, and as a result, suffer losses on account"
"of foreign currency fluctuations. There is no guarantee that we may be able to manage our foreign currency risk effectively or"
"mitigate exchange exposures, at all times and our inability may harm our results of operations and cause our results to fluctuate"
"and/or decline. We may experience foreign exchange losses and gains in respect of transactions denominated in foreign"
"currencies."

"5.   If the market for our services develops more slowly than we expect, it may hamper our ability to grow as anticipated,"
"and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected."
""
"The market for our analytics services is rapidly evolving. Our future success will depend in large part on the growth and"
"expansion of this market, which is difficult to predict and relies on a number of factors, including client adoption, client demand,"
"changing client needs, the entry of competitive products, the success of existing competitive products, potential clients’"
"willingness to adopt an alternative approach to data collection, storage, and analytics and their willingness to invest in business"
"improvements after significant prior investments in legacy data collection, storage, and processing software. The estimates and"
"assumptions that are used to calculate our market opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no guarantee that the"
"organizations covered by our market opportunity estimates will pay for our services at all or generate any particular level of"
"revenue for us. Further, if we or other data management and analytics providers experience security incidents, loss of or"
"unauthorized access to client data, disruptions in delivery, or other problems, this market as a whole, may be negatively affected."
"If software for the challenges that we address does not achieve widespread adoption, or there is a reduction in demand caused"
"by a lack of client acceptance, technological challenges, weakening economic conditions (including due to the COVID-"
"19 pandemic), security or privacy concerns, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending, or"
"otherwise, or, alternatively, if the market develops but we are unable to continue to penetrate it due to the cost, performance, or"
"other factors, it could result in decreased revenue and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be"
"adversely affected."
""
""
"6.   Our business depends on our ability to remain updated with new technologies and continue to develop digital solutions"
"to address the needs of our clients, failing which our business and results of operations could suffer."
""
"Our success has been based on our ability to remain updated with the latest technologies and effectively use them to enable the"
"integration of data into a common operating environment to facilitate advanced data analysis, knowledge management, and"
"collaboration. We spend substantial amounts of time and money researching and developing ways to use evolving technologies"
"to meet our clients’ and potential clients’ rapidly evolving needs. There is no assurance that the enhancements we make to our"
"offerings or service features, or capabilities, will be successful in deriving more accurate data-driven decisions for our clients"
"or gain market acceptance. If our services do not deliver reliable results, or if we fail to introduce services that meet client"
"preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may fail to retain our existing clients or increase demand for our services."
""
"The introduction of new services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings"

"on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may experience difficulties with solution design, or marketing"
"that delay or prevent introduction or implementation of new offerings, features, or capabilities. The design and development of"
"new offerings or new features and capabilities to our existing offerings may require substantial investment, and we have no"
"assurance that such investments will be successful. If clients do not widely adopt our new services, experiences, features, and"
"capabilities, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment and our business, financial condition, and results of"
"operations may be adversely affected."

"Our new offerings may fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including: defects, errors, or failures or our"
"inability to satisfy client service level requirements; negative publicity or negative private statements about the security,"
"performance, or effectiveness of our offerings; introduction or anticipated introduction of competing services or functionalities"
"by our competitors; inability of our services to scale and perform to meet client demands; receiving qualified or adverse opinions"
"in connection with security or penetration testing, certifications or audits, such as those related to IT controls and security"
"standards and frameworks or compliance; poor business conditions for our clients, causing them to delay use of our services;"
"and reluctance of clients to outsource data and analytics functions as compared to carrying these out internally."
""
"If we are not able to continue to identify challenges faced by our clients and develop or acquire new features and capabilities"
"in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if our services do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition,"
"results of operations, and prospects may suffer and our anticipated revenue growth may not be achieved."
""
"7.   We face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or"
"improve our competitive position."
""
"The markets for data and analytics is very competitive, and we expect such competition to continue or increase in the future. A"
"significant number of companies are offering services that currently, or in the future may, compete with some or all aspects of"
"our analytics services. We may not be successful in convincing the management teams of our potential clients to engage our"
"services to enhance their operations or to prefer our services over those of our competitors. In addition, our competitors include"
"large enterprise software companies and system integrators, and we may face competition from emerging companies as well as"
"established companies who have not previously entered this market. Additionally, we may be required to make substantial"
"additional investments in our personnel, research, development, services, marketing, and sales functions in order to respond to"
"competition, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future."
"23"
"Many of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages"
"such as: greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger client bases; larger sales and marketing budgets and"
"resources and the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of services;"
"broader, deeper, or otherwise more established relationships with technology, channel and distribution partners, and clients;"
"wider geographic presence or greater access to larger potential client bases; greater focus in specific geographies; lower labor"
"and research and development costs; larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and substantially greater financial,"
"technical, and other resources to provide services."
""
"In addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse service offerings and may be able to"
"leverage their relationships with distribution partners and clients to gain business in a manner that discourages clients from"
"procuring our services. Potential clients may also prefer to engage their existing providers rather than new providers regardless"
"of service features. As a result, even if our services offer advantages that others do not, clients may not engage us for their"
"analytics requirements. These larger competitors often have specialized market focus or greater resources and may therefore"
"not be as susceptible to economic downturns or other significant reductions in capital spending by clients. If we are unable to"
"sufficiently differentiate our offerings from the integrated or bundled products of our competitors, such as by offering enhanced"
"value, we may see a decrease in demand for our services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and"

""
"Since many of our specific client engagements involve highly tailored solutions, our corporate reputation is a significant factor"

"believe that our brand name and reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our"

"revenues and against which our patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence. From time-to-time, third parties, including"
"certain of these leading companies and non-practicing entities, may assert patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual"
"property rights against us, our partners, our technology partners or our clients. We may in the future receive, notices that claim"
"we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed other parties’ intellectual property rights, and to the extent we gain greater"

"be expensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management’s attention and other resources. These claims could also"
"subject us to significant liability for damages, or enhanced statutory damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents"
"or copyrights. These claims could also result in our having to stop using technology found to be in violation of a third-party’s"
"rights. We might be required to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or"
"at all. Even if a license were available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating"
"expenses. Such risks will increase as we continue to expand our operations and offerings. If we cannot license or develop"

"techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems and data, and such techniques continue to evolve, we may be unable"
"to anticipate attempted security breaches and incidents and proactively implement adequate preventative measures."
"Additionally, with so many of our employees now working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may face an increased"

"cloud services, our security measures or those of our third-party service providers could be breached or otherwise fail to prevent"
"unauthorized access to or disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or destruction of such information. Computer malware, viruses,"
"social engineering (phishing attacks), and increasingly sophisticated network attacks have become more prevalent in our"

"clients, wherein fraudsters send unsolicited mails to our clients seeking account sensitive information or to infect client"
"machines to search and attempt ex-filtration of account sensitive information; (ii) hacking – wherein attackers seek to hack into"

"The Indian economy and its securities markets are influenced by economic developments and volatility in securities markets in"

"of companies located elsewhere, including India. Adverse economic developments, such as rising fiscal or trade deficit, in other"
"emerging market countries may also affect investor confidence and cause increased volatility in Indian securities markets and"
"indirectly affect the Indian economy in general. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to"
"capital, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price"
"of our Equity Shares. Any financial disruption could have an adverse effect on our business, future financial performance,"

"condition. Also, a change in the government or a change in the economic and deregulation policies could adversely affect"
"economic conditions prevalent in the areas in which we operate in general and our business in particular and high rates of"

"flooding and earthquakes), epidemics, pandemics such as COVID-19, acts of war, terrorist attacks and other events, many of"
"which are beyond our control, may lead to economic instability, including in India or globally, which may in turn materially"
"and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations may be adversely affected by"
"fires, natural disasters and/or severe weather, which can result in damage to our property and generally reduce our productivity"
"and may require us to evacuate personnel and suspend operations. Any terrorist attacks or civil unrest as well as other adverse"
"social, economic and political events in India or countries where we have operations could have a negative effect on us. Such"
"incidents could also create a greater perception that investment in Indian companies involves a higher degree of risk and could"
"have an adverse effect on our business and the price of the Equity Shares. A number of countries in Asia, including India, as"
"well as countries in other parts of the world, are susceptible to contagious diseases and, for example, have had confirmed cases"
"of diseases such as the highly pathogenic H7N9, H5N1 and H1N1 strains of influenza in birds and swine and more recently,"

"from S&P is BBB-with a “stable” outlook. Any further adverse revisions to India’s credit ratings for domestic and international"
"debt by international rating agencies may adversely impact our ability to raise additional financing. A downgrading of India’s"

"could have a global influence and thereby negatively affect the Indian economy. Financial disruptions could materially and"
"adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, economic"
"developments globally can have a significant impact on our principal markets. Concerns related to a trade war between large"
"economies may lead to increased risk aversion and volatility in global capital markets and consequently have an impact on the"
"Indian economy. Following the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union (“Brexit”), there remains significant"
"uncertainty around the terms of their future relationship with the European Union and, more generally, as to the impact of"
"Brexit on the general economic conditions in the United Kingdom and the European Union and any consequential impact on"
"global financial markets. For example, Brexit could give rise to increased volatility in foreign exchange rate movements and"
"the value of equity and debt investments."
"In addition, China is one of India’s major trading partners and there are rising concerns of a possible slowdown in the Chinese"
"economy as well as a strained relationship with India, which could have an adverse impact on the trade relations between the"
"two countries. In response to such developments, legislators and financial regulators in the United States and other"
"jurisdictions, including India, implemented a number of policy measures designed to add stability to the financial markets."
"However, the overall long-term effect of these and other legislative and regulatory efforts on the global financial markets is"
"uncertain, and they may not have the intended stabilizing effects. Any significant financial disruption could have a material"
"adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. These developments, or the perception that any"
"of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the"
"stability of global financial markets and may significantly reduce global market liquidity, restrict the ability of key market"
"41"
"participants to operate in certain financial markets or restrict our access to capital. This could have a material adverse effect on"
"our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of the Equity Shares."
"57. If there is any change in laws or regulations, including taxation laws, or their interpretation, such changes may"
"significantly affect our financial statements."
""
"Our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavourable changes in, or interpretations of existing"
"laws, or the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations applicable to us and our business. For further details, see “Key"
"Regulations and Policies” on page 143."
""
"The regulatory and policy environment in which we operate is evolving and subject to change. There can be no assurance that"
"the Government of India may not implement new regulations and policies which will require us to obtain approvals and licenses"
"from the Government and other regulatory bodies, or impose onerous requirements, conditions, costs and expenditures on our"
"operations. Any such changes and the related uncertainties with respect to the implementation of the new regulations may have"
"a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may have to"
"incur capital expenditures to comply with the requirements of any new regulations, which may also materially harm our results"
"of operations and cash flows. Any changes to such laws, including the instances briefly mentioned below, may adversely affect"
"our business, results of operations and financial condition."
""
"Any change in Indian tax laws could have an effect on our operations. For instance, the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance,"
"2019, a new tax ordinance issued by India’s Ministry of Finance on September 20, 2019, prescribes certain changes to the"
"income tax rate applicable to companies in India. According to this new ordinance, companies can henceforth voluntarily opt"
"in favor of a concessional tax regime (subject to no other special benefits/exemptions being claimed), which would ultimately"
"reduce the effective tax rate for Indian companies from 34.94% to approximately 25.17%. Any such future amendments may"
"affect our ability to claim exemptions that we have historically benefited from, and such exemptions may no longer be available"
"to us."
""
"The Finance Act, 2020 (“Finance Act”), has, amongst others things, provided a number of amendments to the direct and"
"indirect tax regime, including, without limitation, a simplified alternate direct tax regime and that dividend distribution tax"
"(“DDT”), will not be payable in respect of dividends declared, distributed or paid by a domestic company after March 31, 2020,"
"and accordingly, such dividends would not be exempt in the hands of the shareholders, both resident as well as non-resident"
"and are likely be subject to tax deduction at source. The Company may or may not grant the benefit of a tax treaty (where"
"applicable) to a non-resident shareholder for the purposes of deducting tax at source from such dividend. Investors should"
"consult their own tax advisors about the consequences of investing or trading in the Equity Shares."
"In addition, we are subject to tax related inquiries and claims. We may be particularly affected by claims from tax authorities"
"on account of income tax assessment, service tax and GST that combines taxes and levies by the central and state governments"
"into one unified rate of interest with effect from July 1, 2017."
"Further, the Government of India has announced the union budget for the Fiscal 2022, pursuant to which the Finance Bill, 2021"
"(“Finance Bill”) has introduced various amendments. The Finance Bill has received assent from the President of India on March"
"28, 2021, and has been enacted as the Finance Act, 2021 (“Finance Act”). We have not fully determined the impact of these"
"recent and proposed laws and regulations on our business. We cannot predict whether any amendments made pursuant to the"
"Finance Act would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations."
"Unfavourable changes in or interpretations of existing, or the promulgation of new, laws, rules and regulations including foreign"
"investment and stamp duty laws governing our business and operations could result in us being deemed to be in contravention"
"of such laws and may require us to apply for additional approvals. The Finance Act has also clarified that, in the absence of a"
"specific provision under an agreement, the liability to pay stamp duty in case of sale of securities through stock exchanges will"
"be on the buyer, while in other cases of transfer of consideration through a depository, the onus will be on the transferor. The"
"stamp duty for transfer of securities other than debentures, on a delivery basis is specified at 0.015% and on a non-delivery"
"basis is specified at 0.003% of the consideration amount."
"We cannot predict whether any new tax laws or regulations impacting our services will be enacted, what the nature and impact"
"of the specific terms of any such laws or regulations will be or whether, if at all, any laws or regulations would have an adverse"
"effect on our business. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors in relation to the consequences of investing"
"in the Equity Shares."
"58. If inflation were to rise in India or in other countries where we operate, we might not be able to increase the prices of"
"our services at a proportional rate in order to pass costs on to our clients thereby reducing our margins."
""
"Inflation rates have been volatile in recent years, and such volatility may continue in the future. India has experienced high"
"inflation in the recent past. Increased inflation can contribute to an increase in interest rates and increased costs to our business,"
"including increased costs of transportation, wages, raw materials and other expenses relevant to our business."
""
""
"42"
"High fluctuations in inflation rates may make it more difficult for us to accurately estimate or control our costs. Any increase"
"in inflation in India can increase our expenses, which we may not be able to adequately pass on to our clients, whether entirely"
"or in part, and may adversely affect our business and financial condition. In particular, we might not be able to reduce our costs"
"or increase the price of our services to pass the increase in costs on to our clients. In such case, our business, results of operations,"
"cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected."
"Further, the Government of India has previously initiated economic measures to combat high inflation rates, and it is unclear"
"whether these measures will remain in effect. There can be no assurance that Indian inflation levels will not worsen in the"
"future."
"59. A third party could be prevented from acquiring control of us post this Offer, because of anti-takeover provisions under"
"Indian law."
""
"As a listed Indian entity, there are provisions in Indian law that may delay, deter or prevent a future takeover or change in"
"control of our Company. Under the Takeover Regulations, an acquirer has been defined as any person who, directly or"
"indirectly, acquires or agrees to acquire shares or voting rights or control over a company, whether individually or acting in"
"concert with others. Although these provisions have been formulated to ensure that interests of investors/shareholders are"
"protected, these provisions may also discourage a third party from attempting to take control of our Company subsequent to"
"completion of the Offer. Consequently, even if a potential takeover of our Company would result in the purchase of the Equity"
"Shares at a premium to their market price or would otherwise be beneficial to our shareholders, such a takeover may not be"
"attempted or consummated because of Takeover Regulations."
""
"60. Investors may not be able to enforce a judgment of a foreign court against us."
""
"Our Company is a company incorporated under the laws of India. A majority of our Company’s Directors and officers are"
"residents of India and a substantial portion of our assets and such persons are located in India. As a result, it may not be possible"
"for investors to effect service of process upon our Company or such persons in jurisdictions outside India, or to enforce"
"judgments obtained against such parties outside India. Furthermore, it is unlikely that an Indian court would enforce foreign"
"judgments if that court was of the view that the amount of damages awarded was excessive or inconsistent with public policy,"
"or if judgments are in breach or contrary to Indian law. In addition, a party seeking to enforce a foreign judgment in India is"
"required to obtain approval from the RBI to execute such a judgment or to repatriate outside India any amounts recovered."
""
"Recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments is provided for under Section 13 and Section 44A of the Code of Civil"
"Procedure, 1908. India has reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters with only a"
"limited number of jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, Singapore and Hong Kong. In order to be enforceable, a judgment"
"from a jurisdiction with reciprocity must meet certain requirements established in the Indian Code of Civil Procedure, 1908."
"The CPC only permits the enforcement and execution of monetary decrees in the reciprocating jurisdiction, not being in the"
"nature of any amounts payable in respect of taxes, other charges, fines or penalties. Judgments or decrees from jurisdictions"
"which do not have reciprocal recognition with India, including the United States, cannot be enforced by proceedings in"
"execution in India. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in a non-reciprocating"
"territory for civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the general laws of the non-reciprocating territory, would"
"not be directly enforceable in India. The party in whose favour a final foreign judgment in a non-reciprocating territory is"
"rendered may bring a fresh suit in a competent court in India based on the final judgment within three years of obtaining such"
"final judgment. However, it is unlikely that a court in India would award damages on the same basis as a foreign court if an"
"action were brought in India or that an Indian court would enforce foreign judgments if it viewed the amount of damages as"
"excessive or inconsistent with the public policy in India."
"Risks Relating to the Equity Shares and this Offer"
"61. The trading volume and market price of the Equity Shares may be volatile following the Offer."
"The market price of the Equity Shares may fluctuate as a result of, among other things, the following factors, some of which"
"are beyond our control:"
""
"•        quarterly variations in our results of operations;"
"•        results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;"
"•        results of operations that vary from those of our competitors;"
"•        changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by research analysts and"
"investors;"
"•        a change in research analysts’ recommendations;"
""
""
""
"43"
"•        announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint operations or capital"
"commitments;"
"•        announcements by third parties or governmental entities of significant claims or proceedings against us;"
"•        new laws and governmental regulations applicable to our industry;"
"•        additions or departures of key management personnel;"
"•        changes in exchange rates;"
"•        fluctuations in stock market prices and volume; and"
"•        general economic and stock market conditions."
"Changes in relation to any of the factors listed above could adversely affect the price of the Equity Shares."
"62. The Offer Price of the Equity Shares may not be indicative of the market price of the Equity Shares after the Offer."
""
"The Offer Price of the Equity Shares will be determined by our Company in consultation with the Book Running Lead Manager"
"through the Book Building Process. This price will be based on numerous factors, as described under “Basis for Offer Price”"
"on page 83 and may not be indicative of the market price for the Equity Shares after the Offer. The market price of the Equity"
"Shares could be subject to significant fluctuations after the Offer, and may decline below the Offer Price. We cannot assure you"
"that you will be able to resell their Equity Shares at or above the Offer Price."
""
"63. There is no guarantee that our Equity Shares will be listed on the BSE and NSE in a timely manner or at all."
""
"In accordance with Indian law and practice, permission for listing and trading of our Equity Shares will not be granted until"
"after certain actions have been completed in relation to this Offer and until Allotment of Equity Shares pursuant to this Offer."
""
"In accordance with current regulations and circulars issued by SEBI, our Equity Shares are required to be listed on the BSE and"
"NSE within such time as mandated under UPI Circulars, subject to any change in the prescribed timeline in this regard."
"However, we cannot assure you that the trading in our Equity Shares will commence in a timely manner or at all. Any failure"
"or delay in obtaining final listing and trading approvals may restrict your ability to dispose of your Equity Shares."
""
"64. The Equity Shares have never been publicly traded and the Offer may not result in an active or liquid market for the"
"Equity Shares. Further, the price of the Equity Shares may be volatile, and the investors may be unable to resell the"
"Equity Shares at or above the Offer Price, or at all."
""
"Prior to the Offer, there has been no public market for the Equity Shares, and an active trading market on the stock exchanges"
"may not develop or be sustained after the Offer. Listing and quotation does not guarantee that a market for the Equity Shares"
"will develop, or if developed, the liquidity of such market for the Equity Shares. The market price of the Equity Shares may be"
"subject to significant fluctuations in response to, among other factors, variations in our operating results, market conditions"
"specific to the industry we operate in, developments relating to India and volatility in the Stock Exchanges and securities"
"markets elsewhere in the world."
""
"65. Investors may be subject to Indian taxes arising out of income arising on the sale of the Equity Shares."
""
"Under current Indian tax laws, unless specifically exempted, capital gains arising from the sale of equity shares held as"
"investments in an Indian company are generally taxable in India. Any capital gain realised on the sale of listed equity shares on"
"a Stock Exchange held for more than 12 months immediately preceding the date of transfer will be subject to long term capital"
"gains in India at the specified rates depending on certain factors, such as whether the sale is undertaken on or off the Stock"
"Exchanges, the quantum of gains and any available treaty relief. Accordingly, you may be subject to payment of long term"
"capital gains tax in India, in addition to payment of Securities Transaction Tax (“STT”), on the sale of any Equity Shares held"
"for more than 12 months immediately preceding the date of transfer. STT will be levied on and collected by a domestic stock"
"exchange on which the Equity Shares are sold. Further, any capital gains realised on the sale of listed equity shares held for a"
"period of 12 months or less immediately preceding the date of transfer will be subject to short term capital gains tax in India."
"Capital gains arising from the sale of the Equity Shares will not be chargeable to tax in India in cases where relief from such"
"taxation in India is provided under a treaty between India and the country of which the seller is resident and the seller is entitled"
"to avail benefits thereunder. Generally, Indian tax treaties do not limit India’s ability to impose tax on capital gains. As a result,"
"residents of other countries may be liable for tax in India as well as in their own jurisdiction on a gain upon the sale of the"
"Equity Shares."
"Similarly, any business income realised from the transfer of Equity Shares held as trading assets is taxable at the applicable tax"
"rates subject to any treaty relief, if applicable, to a non-resident seller. Additionally, in terms of the Finance Act, 2018,"
"44"
"which has been notified on March 29, 2018 with effect from April 1, 2018, the tax payable by an assesse on the capital"
"gains arising from transfer of long term capital asset (introduced as section 112A of the Income-Tax Act, 1961) shall be"
"calculated on such long-term capital gains at the rate of 10%, where the long-term capital gains exceed ₹100,000, subject"
"to certain exceptions in case of a resident individuals and HUF."
"66. Investors will not be able to sell immediately on an Indian stock exchange any of the Equity Shares they purchase in"
"the Offer."
""
"The Equity Shares will be listed on the Stock Exchanges. Pursuant to applicable Indian laws, certain actions must be completed"
"before the Equity Shares can be listed and trading in the Equity Shares may commence. Investors’ book entry, or ‘demat’"
"accounts with depository participants in India, are expected to be credited with the Equity Shares within one working day of"
"the date on which the Basis of Allotment is approved by the Stock Exchanges. The Allotment of Equity Shares in this Offer"
"and the credit of such Equity Shares to the applicant’s demat account with depository participant could take approximately six"
"Working Days from the Bid Closing Date and trading in the Equity Shares upon receipt of final listing and trading approvals"
"from the Stock Exchanges is expected to commence within six Working Days of the Bid Closing Date. There could be a failure"
"or delay in listing of the Equity Shares on the Stock Exchanges. Any failure or delay in obtaining the approval or otherwise any"
"delay in commencing trading in the Equity Shares would restrict investors’ ability to dispose of their Equity Shares. There can"
"be no assurance that the Equity Shares will be credited to investors’ demat accounts, or that trading in the Equity Shares will"
"commence, within the time periods specified in this risk factor. We could also be required to pay interest at the applicable rates"
"if allotment is not made, refund orders are not dispatched or demat credits are not made to investors within the prescribed time"
"periods."
""
"67. Any future issuance of Equity Shares, or convertible securities or other equity linked instruments by us may dilute your"
"shareholding and sale of Equity Shares by the Promoters may adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares."
""
"We may be required to finance our growth through future equity offerings. Any future equity issuances by us, including a"
"primary offering of Equity Shares, convertible securities or securities linked to Equity Shares including through exercise of"
"employee stock options, may lead to the dilution of investors’ shareholdings in our Company. Any future equity issuances by"
"us or sales of our Equity Shares by the Promoters may adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares, which may lead"
"to other adverse consequences including difficulty in raising capital through offering of our Equity Shares or incurring"
"additional debt. In addition, any perception by investors that such issuances or sales might occur may also affect the market"
"price of our Equity Shares. There can be no assurance that we will not issue Equity Shares, convertible securities or securities"
"linked to Equity Shares or that our Shareholders will not dispose of, pledge or encumber their Equity Shares in the future."
""
"68. Significant differences exist between Ind AS and other accounting principles, such as Indian GAAP, U.S. GAAP and"
"IFRS, which investors may be more familiar with and may consider material to their assessment of our financial"
"condition."
""
"Our Restated Consolidated Financial Information for Fiscal 2019, 2020 and 2021, have been prepared and presented in"
"conformity with Ind AS. Ind AS differs in certain significant respects from Indian GAAP, IFRS, U.S. GAAP and other"
"accounting principles with which prospective investors may be familiar in other countries. If our Restated Consolidated"
"Financial Information were to be prepared in accordance with such other accounting principles, our results of operations, cash"
"flows and financial position may be substantially different. Prospective investors should review the accounting policies applied"
"in the preparation of our financial statements, and consult their own professional advisers for an understanding of the differences"
"between these accounting principles and those with which they may be more familiar. Any reliance by persons not familiar"
"with Indian accounting practices on the financial disclosures presented in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus should be limited"
"accordingly."
""
"69. QIBs and Non-Institutional Investors are not permitted to withdraw or lower their Bids (in terms of quantity of Equity"
"Shares or the Bid Amount) at any stage after the submission of their Bid, and Retail Individual Investors are not"
"permitted to withdraw their Bids after closure of the Bid/ Offer Closing Date."
""
"Pursuant to the SEBI ICDR Regulations, QIBs and Non-Institutional Investors are required to pay the Bid Amount on"
"submission of the Bid and are not permitted to withdraw or lower their Bids (in terms of quantity of Equity Shares or the Bid"
"Amount) at any stage after submitting a Bid. Retail Individual Investors can revise their Bids during the Bid/ Offer Period and"
"withdraw their Bids until the Bid/ Offer Closing Date. While we are required to complete all necessary formalities for listing"
"and commencement of trading of the Equity Shares on all Stock Exchanges where such Equity Shares are proposed to be listed,"
"including Allotment, within six Working Days from the Bid/ Offer Closing Date or such other period as may be prescribed by"
"the SEBI, events affecting the investors’ decision to invest in the Equity Shares, including adverse changes in international or"
"national monetary policy, financial, political or economic conditions, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial"
"condition may arise between the date of submission of the Bid and Allotment. We may complete the Allotment of the Equity"
"45"
"Shares even if such events occur, and such events may limit the Investors’ ability to sell the Equity Shares Allotted pursuant to"
"the Offer or cause the trading price of the Equity Shares to decline on listing."
"70. The requirements of being a publicly listed company may strain our resources."
"We are not a publicly listed company and have not, historically, been subjected to the increased scrutiny of our affairs by"
"shareholders, regulators and the public at large that is associated with being a listed company. As a listed company, we will"
"incur significant legal, accounting, corporate governance and other expenses that we did not incur as an unlisted company. We"
"will be subject to the SEBI Listing Regulations, which will require us to file audited annual and unaudited quarterly reports"
"with respect to our business and financial condition. If we experience any delays, we may fail to satisfy our reporting obligations"
"and/or we may not be able to readily determine and accordingly report any changes in our results of operations as promptly as"
"other listed companies."
"Further, as a publicly listed company, we will need to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and"
"procedures and internal control over financial reporting, including keeping adequate records of daily transactions. In order to"
"maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting,"
"significant resources and management attention will be required. As a result, our management’s attention may be diverted from"
"our business concerns, which may adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. In"
"addition, we may need to hire additional legal and accounting staff with appropriate experience and technical accounting"
"knowledge, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in a timely and efficient manner."
"71. Compliance with provisions of Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act may affect payments on the Equity Shares."
""
"The U.S. “Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act” (or “FATCA”) imposes a new reporting regime and potentially, imposes a"
"30% withholding tax on certain “foreign passthru payments” made by certain non-U.S. financial institutions (including"
"intermediaries)."
""
"If payments on the Equity Shares are made by such non-U.S. financial institutions (including intermediaries), this withholding"
"may be imposed on such payments if made to any non-U.S. financial institution (including an intermediary) that is not otherwise"
"exempt from FATCA or other holders who do not provide sufficient identifying information to the payer, to the extent such"
"payments are considered “foreign passthru payments”. Under current guidance, the term “foreign passthru payment” is not"
"defined and it is therefore not clear whether and to what extent payments on the Equity Shares would be considered “foreign"
"passthru payments”. The United States has entered into intergovernmental agreements with many jurisdictions (including India)"
"that modify the FATCA withholding regime described above. It is not yet clear how the intergovernmental agreements between"
"the United States and these jurisdictions will address “foreign passthru payments” and whether such agreements will require us"
"or other financial institutions to withhold or report on payments on the Equity Shares to the extent they are treated as “foreign"
"passthru payments”. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of FATCA, or any"
"intergovernmental agreement or non-U.S. legislation implementing FATCA, to their investment in Equity Shares."
"72. U.S. holders should consider the impact of the passive foreign investment company rules in connection with an"
"investment in our Equity Shares."
""
"A foreign corporation will be treated as a passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes"
"for any taxable year in which either: (i) at least 75% of its gross income is “passive income” or (ii) at least 50% of its gross"
"assets during the taxable year (based on of the quarterly values of the assets during a taxable year) are “passive assets,” which"
"generally means that they produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income."
""
"Our Company believes it was not a PFIC for fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, and does not expect to be a PFIC for the current"
"year or any future years. However, no assurance can be given that our Company will or will not be considered a PFIC in the"
"current or future years. The determination of whether or not our Company is a PFIC is a factual determination that is made"
"annually after the end of each taxable year, and there can be no assurance that our Company will not be considered a PFIC in"
"the current taxable year or any future taxable year because, among other reasons, (i) the composition of our Company’s income"
"and assets will vary over time, and (ii) the manner of the application of relevant rules is uncertain in several respects. Further,"
"our Company’s PFIC status may depend on the market price of its Equity Shares, which may fluctuate considerably."

"•   The ongoing pandemic has resulted in significant lag in decision making and also uncertainty in continuation of orders from"
"new clients. We believe that given the current environment, in the event sales closures do not materialise, Subsidiaries need a"
"clear runway of three years to scale up and start performing."

""
"Global IT Spending Overview"
""
"In 2020, COVID-19 affected the global economy significantly. However, with the distribution of vaccines, the global economy is"
"expected to recover at a greater pace than initially projected. According to the World Bank, the global economy is set to expand by 5.6%"
"in 2021 – its strongest post-recession pace in nearly 80 years."
""
"China and USA will continue to lead the GDP growth in 2021, contributing to about a quarter of the global GDP growth. In the US, a"
"fiscal support of nearly $5.9 trillion and accelerated vaccination drives are expected to boost the economy, and growth is expected to"
"reach 6.8% by this year – the fastest pace since 1984. China’s economy, which had limited impact last year, is expected to grow at 8.5%"
"as the country shifts focus on reducing financial instability. While at the onset of the pandemic Europe led to a recession, the easing of"
"lockdowns and subsequent social distancing guidelines, along with huge public investment programmes are expected to fuel a sharp"
"recovery. According to the European Commission’s forecast, GDP is expected to grow by 4.2% in 2021 and by 4.4% in 2022, compared"
"to the earlier prediction of 3.7% and 3.9% respectively, in February this year. Even in emerging economies like India, GDP is forecasted"
"to grow at 7.5% in 2022, despite the severe impact on recovery by an unprecedented second wave of COVID -19."
""
""
""
""
"93"
"The global IT spend is also expected to recover to reach approximately $4 trillion by 2024. While business related uncertainties led to"
"enterprises putting large scale expansion plans on hold in 2020, investments on IT have since then recovered as businesses prepare for"
"the next wave of growth supported by a buoyant economy. However, as enterprises prepare for a post COVID-19 future, IT spending"
"priorities are expected to change."
""
""
""
""
"Digital Technologies will be at the forefront of transformation initiatives as enterprises globally gear up for a new normal"
""
"In the pre-pandemic era, technology leaders across industries were accustomed to incremental increases in IT budgets, with almost 60%"
"of the budget in 2019 spent on legacy applications such as outdated architecture and software components that were harder to integrate"
"with newer systems. While most enterprises were focused on prioritizing cost and efficiency initiatives, a few of them invested in digital"
"initiatives such as Analytics, Cloud-based enterprise applications, and customer experience technologies like Artificial Intelligence,"
"Augmented Realities, for driving innovation, growth, and improved customer experience."
""
""
""
""
"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a digital divide – enterprises that had invested in digital initiatives were better placed compared to"
"the others. Consequently, technology leaders across industries are undertaking efforts to minimize the spend on maintenance of legacy"
"applications, and rapidly scaling up investments in digital technologies to fuel growth. As a result, growth in IT spend is expected to be"
"largely driven by investments in digital technologies as enterprises scale up digital transformation efforts across business units."
"Investment in digital technologies is expected to double from 2020 levels to approximately US$2.4 trillion in 2024."
""
"Changing consumer preferences and organizational priorities have accelerated investment in digital technologies. Some of the key use-"
"cases driving adoption of digital technologies are mentioned below:"
""
""
"94"
"Operational Efficiency. There is a shift from providing core data to generating analytical insights to inform decision-making processes"
"and optimizing workflows across interrelated business activities. Real-time and precise insights on business operations and consumer"
"spending patterns are critical for enterprises to maximize our value at reduced costs. Consequently, analytics and automation are"
"leveraged across industries for a variety of uses such as forecasting demand, optimizing supply chains, maximizing ROI from"
"promotional spending, predicting fraud and machine failures."
""
""
"Contactless Digital Customer Engagements. As a long-term impact of the pandemic, the demand for contactless digital customer"
"engagements are expected to continue. Investments in technology as enablers for the new digital business model has therefore"
"significantly increased."
""
""
"Remote Collaboration. Due to the pandemic, hybrid work environments balancing remote work as well as work in physical offices is"
"expected to become the norm, leading to more spending on systems and tools for virtual communication and collaboration."
""
""
"Infrastructure modernization. While public Cloud transformation had gained popularity, the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the pace"
"of adoption. Enterprise spending on Cloud infrastructure is expected to continue to grow at 18%, owing to the demand from e-Commerce"
"activity, virtual collaboration requirements, and the need to minimize cost while adding flexibility and scale to IT operations."
""
""
"Data & Analytics Overview – Data & Analytics is one of the fastest growing segments of the digital spend"
"Across industries, Data & Analytics (D&A) are being leveraged by enterprises to guide business strategy and optimize spending"
"decisions during growing financial uncertainties. The growing adoption of D&A software and services across industries are driven by"
"the need to:"
""
""
"Manage the Data Explosion: Growing e-Commerce activities and the increased preference for contactless customer engagements have"
"led to the creation of high volumes of customer data across industries. Data is being collected in different formats from a variety of"
"sources. Inherent structural inconsistencies in the data collected and the need to consolidate data under different departments into a"
"single unified view have led to the growth in D&A spend across industries."
""
""
"Provide Differentiated User Experience: The major factor driving growth of the market is the need to understand consumer buying"
"behaviour to provide a more differentiated and personalised customer experience. Enterprises are leveraging D&A to differentiate"
"product offerings and respond quickly to changes in consumer preferences. The power of Big Data and AI/ ML is increasingly"
"being leveraged by enterprises to identify spending patterns and customer buying behaviour for customer segmentation, feature"
"prioritization, and predicting future demand."
""
""
"Optimize Business Decision-making: Business Intelligence and visualization are extensively leveraged by enterprises to track business"
"metrics/KPIs against business goals. Data science and advanced algorithms are used to build advanced analytics applications to find"
"optimal solutions for channel investment, promotional spending, warehouse transport, product assortment."
""
""
"Reduce Risks: Post pandemic, increased online activity has led to a surge in fraudulent activities across industries. The BFSI industry"
"alone has seen significant growth in fraudulent activities in 2020. Increasingly, enterprises are leveraging D&A, powered by ML"
"algorithms, to detect and prevent fraud using historical transactions and social media interactions. Moreover, D&A can also help predict"
"machine failures, minimizing the risk of business downtime."
"The market for Data & Analytics was approximately $174 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18% to approximately"
"$333 billion by 2024. Digital native businesses have been at the forefront of adopting advanced analytics to stay ahead of the competition."

"Data & Analytics (D&A) – Horizontals"
""
"D&A applications can be segmented into four horizontals – enterprise data management, descriptive & diagnostic, predictive, and"
"prescriptive."
""
""
""
""
"Enterprise Data Management (EDM)"
""
"EDM refers to a set of processes, practices, and activities focused on consolidating data from disparate sources. EDM can be further"
"segmented into five core buckets: (i) Data Integration: The process of combining data as-is from several different sources into a unified"
"repository; (ii) Data Engineering: The process of addressing underlying structural inconsistencies in the data. Proliferation of different"
"devices and different data structures supported by these devices have led to structural inconsistencies in the collected data. Data"
"Engineering aims to resolve this issue by performing data cleansing and integrity checks before storing it in data warehouses for use by"
"downstream applications, As a result of the growth anticipated for data and analytics services, there is corresponding growth expected"
"in the field of data engineering as well.; (iii) Master Data Management: The process of maintaining a single source of truth for key"
"business data across multiple systems, processes, and applications; (iv) Data Security: The process of securing key business process"
"information or other sensitive enterprise data from any data loss or privacy breaches; and (v) Data Governance: A set of policies designed"
"to protect the privacy of customer information and adheres to rules and regulations."
""
""
""
"96"
"Descriptive & Diagnostic Analytics"
""
"Descriptive & Diagnostic Analytics provide insights on past business events using historical data and statistical tools. It leverages BI"
"and visual analytics to identify potential causes behind past business events. Modelling and basic regression techniques are applied to"
"establish the relationship between past business events and extract insights for ad-hoc reporting. Self-service visualization with in-built"
"data exploration tools is used by stakeholders to isolate confounding information for root cause analysis."
""
"Predictive Analytics"
""
"Predictive Analytics leverages data mining and advanced statistical models to derive insights from historical and transactional data to"
"identify patterns and predict future trends. Data Mining refers to the extraction of patterns, including anomalies, within large data sets"
"using ML algorithms. Predictive Modelling refers to a combination of different statistical modelling techniques to draw up predictions"
"about future trends."
""
"Prescriptive Analytics"
""
"Prescriptive Analytics uses several complex techniques to recommend the best course of action for employees and agents of a business."
"Core techniques used in Prescriptive Analytics include: (i) Optimization, the process of finding an optimal solution to a business problem"
"by leveraging advanced mathematical models. Real-life business events, are used as inputs to the model to find the best course of action;"
"and (ii) Simulation, building a digital replica of the mathematical model constructed above to examine the corresponding changes to"
"any alteration in the model configuration parameters. Unlike the optimization model which is used to find recommendations, the"
"simulation model allows analysts to identify the impact of unknown variables and explore alternatives."
""
"Data & Analytics spending is expected to rise due to increased adoption of next-generation analytics applications"
""
"The global share of traditional D&A applications like EDM and Descriptive & Diagnostic Analytics is expected to decline from"
"approximately 74% in 2020 to approximately 63% by 2024, as spending in next-generation Analytics applications in Predictive and"
"Prescriptive is expected to increase significantly."
"Low-cost Cloud storage options and mature database technologies are expected to drive down the cost of enterprise data management."
"Spending in traditional applications will be augmented by an increased focus on deriving business insights from the enterprise-wide"
"large data sets. Predictive analytics will be at the forefront of estimating financial and operational risks across industries. Spending on"
"prescriptive will grow exponentially as enterprises will leverage AI/ML techniques to optimize business decision-making."
""
""
""
""

"Enterprise Data Management (EDM) will continue to be at the core of transformative Data Analytics efforts across enterprises"
""
"The global EDM spending is expected to grow from approximately $64 billion in 2020 to $92 billion by 2024 at a CAGR of"
"approximately 10%. In recent years, the growing volume of unstructured data has introduced challenges in data management across"
"industries. Moreover, the increasing number of data sources in BFSI and CPG & Retail further increases the complexity of data"
"management. As a response, BFSI and CPG & Retail verticals are expected to continue investment in EDM services for consolidation"
"of unstructured data generated. EDM spending in Industrial and Healthcare verticals is also expected to grow due to increased adoption"
"of various devices for smart manufacturing and remote patient monitoring respectively."

""
"Client. An online payments platform located in the US."
""
"Problem Statement. While the highly engaged user transacted in multiple verticals, the average user only used the customer’s payment"

""
"Client. A leading US- based multinational software company specializing in digital marketing and digital media products."
""
"Problem Statement. The client had been recording stagnant revenue growth for over three years, even though the overall market had"
"grown substantially in the same period. One of the key challenges identified was that the marketing team was contributing nominally to"
"the sales funnel that had a low conversion rate."
""
"Solution. We helped build a data and analytics infrastructure to enable account based marketing at scale. The data layer integrated"
"account attribute information sourced from multiple external data sources, and account behaviour information at online touchpoints"
""
"134"
"(web pages, email campaigns, downloads, and webinars) and offline touchpoints (events, conferences, sales interactions). The analytics"
"layer used numerous account attributes and behavioural signals to create a holistic view of the account. The initiative also included end-"

"Recommendation System to Increase Share of Wallet for a Largest Food Distribution Company in the US"
""
"Client. Largest food distribution company in the US."
""
"Problem Statement. The client was facing challenges in driving growth. As new customer acquisition is expensive in the industry, the"
"primary focus area was to increase the wallet share of existing customers. An analysis of the existing customer base revealed that repeat"
"orders were relatively low."
""
"Solution. We built a turn-key solution to mine insights from 2TB of transaction history of the client’s vast customer base to provide"
"product recommendations to the field sales teams on their hand-held devices. The solution combined customer segmentation, user-based"
"collaborative filtering, and market basket analysis to provide highly targeted product recommendations for a customer. The solution was"

"Digital Voice of Customer Platform for a Large Home Appliances Manufacturer in the US"
""
"Client. Large US-based home appliances manufacturer."
""
"Problem Statement. The client was unable to maintain its leading market share position and had regressed to third place. One of the"
"primary reasons was that competitors were perceived to have more innovative products which were better aligned with the needs of"
"customers. The client had been using post facto analysis of POS data at stores and analysis of surveys from a sample pool of customers"
"to understand the needs of customers. The insights from these studies would feed into the product development roadmap. The current"
"methodology was able to provide these valuable insights to the product development team only eight months after the product launch."
"The client was looking for ways to significantly reduce the time to get customer feedback, act on insights to drive product innovation"
"and satisfy customers."
""
"Solution. We built a near real-time text analytics platform to utilize unstructured customer feedback data available on free online data"
"sources to ‘measure’ customer feedback of client’s products with respect to competition on various parameters. The platform was used"
"to consolidate external unstructured data available across customer review forums and e-commerce sites to review data across brands in"
"multiple regions and various languages. The automated text analytics engine was able to provide insights into drivers and triggers of"
"purchase, customer sentiment, popular features, customer wish lists and trends. These insights were consumed by several users at various"
"levels and functions across the organization."
""
"Measurable Impact. Insights from customer feedback reached the product development and marketing teams within a shorter period"
"from product launch which was a significant improvement from the traditional approach. The marketing team was able to fine-tune"
"messaging for the new products to improve communication with customers. The product innovation team was able to reduce the product"
"development time and had the ability to prioritize product feature development and integration in a data-driven manner."

""
"Client. Luxury car manufacturer in Europe."

"having a significant negative impact on the bottom line. The client was looking to minimize warranty claims by correlating vehicle"
"usage/ driving styles with expensive and severe claims using IoT data from vehicles."
""
"Solution. We developed a scalable and self-service code-free AI platform for analytics on connected vehicles that could be used to"
"identify vehicle usage patterns by providing data from these vehicles. The analytics platform curates IoT data from cars into a usable"
"format and integrates it to existing data banks for a more detailed understanding of the performance of the overall community. The"
""
"135"
"platform empowers SMEs/ business users to visualize different driving styles and understand top warranty claims for each style. The"
"information is then used to accurately predict future claims for each driving style."
""
"Measurable Impact. One of the first insights uncovered using the AI platform was the identification of a disproportionate increase of"
"warranty costs caused by drivers exhibiting a short trip, long pause driving style. The service and warranty teams are driving initiatives"
"to proactively reduce the cost incurred from such faults."
""
"Improving Home Service Requests Operational Efficiency for Leading Home Appliances and Repair Services Provider"
""
"Client. Leading home appliances and repair services provider located in the US."

"opposed to repair, (ii) competition from fragmented local players with greater flexibility, and (iii) poor service levels resulting in"
"unsatisfactory customer experience."
""
"Solution. We worked with the sales and operations organization across various teams to address these challenges. We commenced by"
"reworking the sales planning exercise by combining forecasts from different algorithms to improve accuracy. Forecasts were evaluated"
"on a monthly basis and appropriately recalibrated. We then performed workforce optimization by running a quadratic optimization"
"model to minimize gap/ surplus and optimize workforce supply. Finally, we performed truck stock optimization to ensure that the right"
"technician with the right parts in the service van is dispatched in the first attempt to service a request."

"among younger women for the past few years. Understanding the make-up and personal care needs of women in the age group of 18"
"years to 34 years is critical in the cosmetics industry."

""
"Client. Leading oil and gas company located in the US"
""
"Problem Statement. The R&D team wanted to optimize experimentation cost by enabling faster access of historical data to researchers."
"One of the key steps in the experimentation was the pre-read process where researchers had to review existing research material to"
""
""
"136"
"understand prior successes and failures in creating active materials. The current historical repository existed in fragmented, disparate"
"data landscapes, in the form of scanned copies of prep sheets."
""
"Solution. We built a solution to convert fragmented and disparate material receipts in the form of physical documents to a digitized and"
"structured format. The digitized documents were then mined for entity information, establishing and predicting relationships between"
"entities. The extracted information was then stored in a graph database without losing the relationship between entities. A user-friendly"
"interface to answer user queries using chat-bots or web applications was developed to increase adoption of the solution."
""
"Measurable Impact. Reduction in the pre-read process resulted in a potential savings for the R&D team."
""
"Bot and Self-Service Platform for a Leading US Retailer"
""
"Client. Leading US-based retailer."

"Problem Statement. Leaders within the client entity relied on ad hoc reports for driving business decisions, which was time consuming"
"and required resources dedicated to coordinating different teams and members. Information was not instantly available in any other form"
"except typical reports, which did not reflect data in real time. The leaders sought to harness new technology to transform this reporting"
"landscape."
""
"Solution. We built a chatbot and an integrated self-service tool to facilitate communication with the bot to obtain required information."
"The user would be able to view details or create custom charts in the self-service tool and download it as a report in excel or PDF"
"formats. The users conveniently view all metrics that were otherwise scattered, in a single window and create reports by simple"
"selections. The user could also use any device including a mobile to converse with the bot, use location related services, among other"
"features."

"Sales and Marketing/ Go-To-Market Approach"
""
"Our marketing and sales efforts are focused on both generating new clients as well as cross-selling and upselling our end-to-end solutions"
"to existing clients. Our salesforce is primarily segregated into field sales and inside sales."
""
""
""
""
"137"
"To align our salesforce more effectively with our clients, we have also organized these distribution channels into geographic territories"
"supported by specialized sales support and centralized sales development teams. As of June 30, 2021, our sales team comprised 23"
"personnel."
""
"The focus of our sales efforts is to build long-term and deep relationships with select strategic clients as compared to a scattered approach."
"These strategic clients are typically the top clients in a particular industry and are independently managed by our directors who own the"
"client relationship and are equipped to sell all solutions. Key account management is facilitated by an onsite client partner in"
"collaboration with an offshore delivery lead. Our field sales team is geographically distributed and leverages existing customer"
"relationships to gain referrals and reach target accounts."
""
""
""
""
"Our incentive mechanism is tailored to incentivize multi-year, high-value deals with Fortune 1000 clients. This has helped accelerate"
"our acquisition of strategic clients in the last few years, with a significant improvement in our deal sizes. Incentives for client servicing"
"teams are pegged to revenue growth at existing and new accounts with additional rewards for winning deals in focus areas. Sales leads"
"are incentivised to drive growth through acquisition of large deals at new clients and new groups through a deal incentive program."
"Sales teams are also entitled to receive additional incentives for meeting and exceeding revenue goals."
""
"Given the breadth of our end-to-end services and increased focus on cross-selling, we have spent considerable time training and"
"upskilling our salesforce in a formal sales training program. We now require sales certifications from our salesforce and have instituted"
"talent assessments and mid-year performance check-ins to ensure we continue to shape our culture to winning and accountability."
""
""

""
""
""
"Contracting and Delivery Model"
""
"Our solutions are generally licensed through a master agreement or online terms and conditions with corresponding product specific"
"terms that are either in separate order forms or are incorporated into the online terms and conditions. The master agreement and online"
"terms cover high-level topics such as license rights and restrictions, confidentiality, data protection and privacy, audit rights, warranties"
"and disclaimers, intellectual property ownership, and termination rights. In some cases, order forms will include the product specific"
"terms such as the solutions being licensed, the specifications, access levels and entitlements for those solutions, pricing, and payment"
"terms. Master agreements are typically evergreen and allow orders to be executed on an ongoing basis and online terms are either annual"
"or have a duration equal to the order to which they relate. Order forms may be for one-year or multi-year periods. Most products and"
"solutions are subject to auto-renewal provisions. Master agreements can be terminated for breach by either party, generally after a cure"

"advanced analytics, machine learning, business intelligence, visualization, and data engineering. There is operational flexibility to"
"scale-up or scale-back the team based on the client’s requirements. Through this engagement model, we undertake a joint"
"responsibility with the client towards goals, execution, and outcome. These contracts are typically multi-year contracts with"
"statements of work being issued annually, occasionally bi-annually and quarterly."
""
"•   Project Based - Project goal, objectives and milestones are identified, defined and finalized for a fixed fee and duration. We are"
"responsible for project management, work schedule and task prioritization based on the project milestones and deliverables. Projects"
"are typically for durations of a few months."
""
"•   Consulting - Value-driven client engagement to enable clients to discover key business problems and create an approach to address"
"them. Pricing is based on the complexity of the problem and potential value to be derived."

"Report). Our competition has historically been very fragmented with many players offering varying levels of data quantity and quality."
"We strive to protect the data and privacy of clients and to maintain the highest standards in the ethical acquisition, aggregation, curation"
"and delivery of data. Our direct competitors vary depending on use cases, such as market segmentation, digital marketing lead generation,"
"lead enrichment, sales effectiveness, and data management."
""
"We believe that the solutions we provide to our clients across different offerings reflect our deep understanding of our clients’ businesses,"

"also seeks to facilitate the electronic filing of documents and to create a mechanism for the authentication of electronic documentation"
"through digital signatures. The IT Act prescribes punishment for publishing and transmitting obscene material in electronic form. The"
"IT Act has extraterritorial jurisdiction over any offence or contravention under the IT Act committed outside India by any person,"
"irrespective of their nationality, if the act or conduct constituting the offence or contravention involves a computer, computer system or"
"computer network located in India. Additionally, the IT Act also empowers the Government of India to direct any of its agencies to"
"intercept, monitor or decrypt any information in the interest of the country’s sovereignty, integrity, defence and security of India, among"
"other things. The Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009"
"specifically permit the Government of India to block access of any information generated, transmitted, received, stored or hosted in any"
"computer resource by the public, the reasons for which are required to be recorded by it in writing."

"By means of an amendment in 2008, the IT Act legalized the validity of contracts formed through electronic means. Additionally, the"
"IT Act creates liability for negligence in dealing with or failure to protect sensitive personal data and gives protection to intermediaries"
"in respect of liabilities for third party information made available to or hosted by them. The Act does so by prescribing civil and criminal"
"liability including fines and imprisonment for computer-related offences including those relating to unauthorized access to computer"
"systems, tampering with or unauthorised manipulation of any computer, computer system or computer network and, damaging computer"
"systems and creates liability for negligence in dealing with or handling any sensitive personal data or information in a computer resource"

"Rules require every such body corporate to provide a privacy policy for handling and dealing with personal information, including"
"sensitive personal data, ensuring the security of all personal data collected by it and publishing such policy on its website. The IT"
"Security Rules further require that all such personal data be used solely for the purposes for which it was collected and any third party"
"disclosure of such data is made with the prior consent of the information provider unless contractually agreed upon between them or"
"where such disclosure is mandated by law."
""
"Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (“Bill”)"
"143"
"The Bill deals with the provisions relating to compensation payable by companies for failure to protect personal data. The Bill also"
"establishes a Data Protection Authority of India. Currently, the Bill categorises two kinds of data, (a) “Personal Data” data about or"

"personal data, which may, reveal, be related to, or constitute: (i) financial data; (ii) health data; (iii) official identifier; (iv) sexual"
"orientation; and (v) biometric data. The Bill accords certain rights to individuals with respect to the protection of their data. However,"
"there are certain exceptions to protection offered under the Bill, such as, act done in interest of security of state, public order, sovereignty"
"and integrity of India and friendly relations with foreign states, and act done for preventing incitement to commission of any cognisable"
"offence relating to the above matters. Processing of personal data is also exempted from provisions of the Bill under certain conditions,"
"as long as such processing is for a specific, clear and lawful purpose, this includes an act undertaken for prevention, investigation, or"
"prosecution of any offence, or personal, domestic, or journalistic purposes. As on date, the Bill is pending with Joint Parliament"
"Committee, and is yet to be notified and take effect."
""
"The Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992 (“Foreign Trade Act”)"
""
"The Foreign Trade Act includes provisions which govern and facilitate the imports and exports to and from India. Imports and exports"
"are permitted by persons who hold an “Importer-exporter code number” (“IEC”). Such imports and exports must be carried out in"
"accordance to the laws and export and import policy issued by the Central Government, from time to time. In the event of any"
"contravention of the laws relating to central excise or customs or foreign exchange or any other economic offence under any other law"

"the Central Government in accordance with The Integrated Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017 and rules framed thereunder. GST is a"
"consumption-based tax; therefore, taxes are paid to the state where the goods or services are consumed and not the state in which they"
"were produced."
""
"Additional tax-related laws that are applicable to us include the Income Tax Act, 1961 along with various rules and notifications issued"
"by the tax authorities."
""
"IV.    Intellectual Property Laws"
""
"145"

"under the Patents Act, 1970, copyright protection under the Copyright Act, 1957 and trademark protection under the Trade Marks Act,"
"1999. These enactments provide for the protection of intellectual property by imposing civil and criminal liability for infringement. In"
"addition to the domestic laws, India is a party to several international intellectual property-related instruments including the Patent"
"Cooperation Treaty, 1970, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, 1883, the Berne Convention for the Protection"
"of Literary and Artistic Works, 1886, the Universal Copyright Convention adopted at Geneva in 1952, the International Convention for"

"Organisation is a signatory to the Agreement on Trade-Related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights."
""
"Trade Marks Act, 1999 and the Trade Marks Rules, 2017"
""
"The Trade Marks Act, 1999 as amended (the “Trade Marks Act”) governs the law pertaining to the protection of trade marks in India."
"Once a mark is registered, it is valid in India only for a period of 10 years and can be renewed from time to time in perpetuity. Registration"
"of a trade mark grants the owner a right to exclusively use the trade mark as a mark of goods and services and provides for remedies in"
"case of the fraudulent use of deceptively similar marks by any third party. The Trade Marks Rules, 2017 as amended (the “Trade Marks"
"Rules”) lays down certain guidelines including the process for determination of “well-known trademark”, representation of sound marks,"
"recognition of e-mail as a mode of service, new registration fees and mandatory filing of statements of users."
"Copyright Act, 1957"
""
"The Copyright Act, 1957, along with the Copyright Rules, 1958, (collectively, “Copyright Laws”) serves to create property rights for"
"certain kinds of intellectual property, generally called works of authorship. The Copyright Laws protect the legal rights of the creator of"
"an ‘original work’ by preventing others from reproducing the work in any other way. This intellectual property protected under the"
"Copyright Laws includes literary works, among others, which, in terms of the Copyright Act, 1957, include computer programs, tables"
"and compilations, including computer databases. The Copyright Laws prescribe a fine, imprisonment or both for violations, with an"
"enhanced penalty on second or subsequent convictions. While copyright registration is not a prerequisite for acquiring or enforcing a"
"copyright in an otherwise copyrightable work, registration constitutes prima facie evidence of the particulars entered therein and may"
"expedite infringement proceedings and reduce delay caused due to evidentiary considerations. Upon registration, the copyright"
"protection for a work exists for a period of 60 years following the demise of the author. Reproduction of a copyrighted work for sale or"
"hire and issuing of copies to the public, among others, without consent of the owner of the copyright are acts which expressly amount"
"to an infringement of copyright."

"the Patents Act further provides that patent protection may not be granted to certain specified types of inventions and materials even if"
"they satisfy the above criteria."
""
"Section 39 of the Patents Act also prohibits any person resident in India from applying for a patent for an invention outside India without"
"making an application for a patent for the same invention in India. The term of a patent granted under the Patents Act pursuant to Section"
"53 is for a period of twenty years from the date of filing of the application for the patent. A patent shall cease to have effect if the renewal"
"fee is not paid within the period prescribed for the payment of such renewal fee."

"Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively."

"Impact on account of Covid 19"
"The Group has considered the possible impact that may arise from COVID-19, a global pandemic, on the carrying amount of its assets including property, plant and"
"equipment, receivables, investments, other current and non current assets. In developing the assumptions relating to the impact of possible future uncertainties in global"
"economic conditions because of this pandemic, the Group, as at the date of approval of these financial statements has used internal and external sources of information"
"including economic forecasts."
"The Company based on current estimates expects the carrying amount of the above assets will be recovered, net of provisions established. The Company has also assessed the"
"impact of this whole situation on its capital and financial resources, profitability, liquidity position, internal financial controls etc., and is of the view that based on its present"
"assessment, this situation does not materially impact these standalone financial statements. However, the impact assessment of COVID-19 is a continuing process, given the"
"uncertainties associnted with its nature and duration. The Group will continue to monitor any material changes to future economic conditions."
""
"E.    Measurement of fair values"
"A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities."
"The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. The Head of Finance has overall responsibility for overseeing all significant"
"fair value measurements."
"The Head of Finance regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used"
"to measure fair values, then the Head of Finance assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of"
"Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified."
"Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:"
"Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities."
"Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)."
"Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)."
""
"When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a"
"liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the"
"lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement."
"The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred."
"Further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in Note 27 – financial instruments."

"B.    Foreign currency transactions"
"Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group at their functional currency spot rates at the date of the transaction."
"Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Exchange differences"
"that arise on settlement of monetary items or on reporting at each balance sheet date are recognised as income or expenses in the period in which they arise. Non-monetary"
"items which are carried at historical cost denominated in a foreign currency are reported using the exchange rates at the date of transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities"
"that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction."
"Foreign operations: The assets and liabilities of foreign operations (subsidiaries) including fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, if any, are translated into INR, the"
"functional currency of the Company, at the exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into INR at the exchange rates at"
"the dates of the transactions or an average rate if the average rate approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency translation differences are"
"recognised in OCI and accumulated in other equity."
""
"C.    Financial instruments"
"i)    Recognition and initial measurement"
"Trade receivables and debt securities are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the"
"Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument."
"A financial asset (except trade receivable, which are recognised initially at transaction price as per Ind AS 115) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for"
"an item not at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue."
""
"ii)   Classification and subsequent measurement"
"Financial assets:"
"On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at"
"-   amortised cost;"
"-   fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) - debt investment"
"-   fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) - equity investment"
"-   fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)"
""
"Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except if and in the period the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets."
"A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:"
"a) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and"
""
"b) the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding."
""
"A debt investment is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it meets both the following conditions and is not designated as FVTPL:"
"a) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and"
""
"b) the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding."
"On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment’s fair value in OCI"
"(designated as FVOCI – equity investment). This election is made on an investment by investment basis."
"All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably"
"designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an"
"accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise."
""
"Financial assets: Business model assessment"
"The Group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is"
"managed and the information is provided to management. The information considered includes:"
"- the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice"
"- these include whether management strategy focuses on earning contractual interest, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of financial assets to"
"the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of assets;"
"- how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management"
"- the risk that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held with in the business model) and how those risks are managed;"
"- how managers of the business are compensated"
"- the frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior period, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity."
"-transfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Company’s"
"continuing recognition of the assets."
"Financial assets that are held for trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on fair value basis are measured at FVTPL."
""
"Financial assets: Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest"
"For the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 'Interest' is defined as consideration for the time value of"
"money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs, as well as a profit"
"margin."
"In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes"
"assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In"
"making this assessment, the Group considers:"
"- contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;"
"- terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable interest rate features;"
"- prepayment and extension features; and"
"- terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets"
""
"A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal"
"and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial"
"asset acquired at a significant discount or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature that pertains or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the"
"contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as"
"consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition."

"iii)   Derecognition"
"Financial assets:"

"flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains"
"substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control of the financial asset."

""
"F.    Impairment"
"i)    Impairment of financial assets"
"The Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost."
"At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit impaired’ when one or more events"
"that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred."
"Evidence that a financial asset is credit impaired includes the following observable data:"
"- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;"
"- a breach of contract such as a default or past dues;"
"- the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;"
"- it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or"
"- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties."
"The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables which do not contain a significant financing component. The"
"application of simplified approach does not require the Group to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime impairment"
"pattern at each balance sheet date, right from its initial recognition."
"The Group always measures the loss allowance for trade receivables at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit loss (ECL). The Company has used a practical expedient by"
"computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix under simplified approach. The provision matrix takes into account historical"
"credit loss experience and adjusted for forward-looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the days the receivables are due."
"Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is"
"written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not"
"have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write‑off. However, financial assets that are written off could"
"still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due."
"The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, except for the following, which are measured as 12 month expected credit losses:"
"- debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and"
"- other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument) has not increased"
"significantly since initial recognition."
"Loss allowances for trade receivables and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses."
"Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument."
"12-month expected credit losses are the portion of expected credit losses that result from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter"
"period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months)."

"In all cases, the maximum period considered when estimating expected credit losses is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk."
"When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating expected credit losses, the Group"
"considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and"
"analysis, based on the Group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward looking information."
"The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:"
"- the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or"
"- the financial asset is more than past due."

"Presentation of allowance for expected credit losses in the balance sheet"
"Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets."
"Write-off"
"The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case"

"However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due."
""
"ii)   Impairment of non-financial assets"
"The Group’s non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such"
"indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated."
"For impairment testing, assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are grouped together into cash-generating units (CGUs). Each CGU represents the smallest group"
"of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs."
"The recoverable amount of a CGU (or an individual asset) is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash"
"flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU (or"
"the asset)."
"The Group’s corporate assets (e.g., head office building for providing support to various CGUs) do not generate independent cash inflows. To determine impairment of a"
"corporate asset, recoverable amount is determined for the CGUs to which the corporate asset belongs."
"An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of"
"profit and loss. Impairment loss recognised in respect of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the"
"carrying amounts of the other assets of the CGU (or group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis."
"An impairment loss in respect of assets for which has been recognised in prior periods, the Group reviews at each reporting date whether there is any indication that the loss"
"has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Such a reversal is made"
"only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment"
"loss had been recognised."
""
"G.    Employee benefits"
"Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount"
"expected to be paid, if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the amount of"
"obligation can be estimated reliably."
"Provident fund: A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or"
"constructive obligation to pay further amounts. The Group makes specified monthly contributions towards Government administered provident fund scheme. Obligations for"
"contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which the related services are rendered by"
"employees."
"Gratuity: The holding company provides for gratuity, a defined benefit plan (the “Gratuity Plan”), covering eligible employees. The Plan provides payment to vested"
"employees at retirement, death or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s salary and the tenure of employment with the Company. The"
"Group provides the gratuity benefit through annual contribution to a fund managed by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). Such contributions are determined by"
"LIC based on actuarial valuation using ""projected unit credit method"" as at the balance sheet date."
""
"Remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability with respect to Gratuity, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the"
"effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised in OCI. The Company determines the net interest expense / (income) on the net defined benefit liability /"
"(asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability /"
"(asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability / (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and"

"Share based payment: The grant date fair value of equity settled share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a"
"corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognised as expense is based on the estimate"
"of the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is"
"based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market vesting conditions at the vesting date."

"H.   Revenue"
"The Group is primarily engaged in the business of rendering analytical services."
"The Group has revenue from customers. The Group recognizes revenue when it satisfies performance obligations under the terms of its contracts, and control of its services is"
"transferred to its customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Group expects to receive from its customers in exchange for those services. This process involves"
"identifying the customer contract, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct"
"performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. A performance obligation is considered distinct from"
"other obligations in a contract when it (a) provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and (b)"
"is separately identified in the contract."
"Taxes assessed by a government authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Group from a"
"customer, are excluded from sales."
""
"A performance obligation is satisfied over time if one of the following criteria are met:"
"— the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the entity performs;"
"— the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or"
"— the entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity, and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date."
""
"If control transfers over time, an entity selects a method to measure progress that is consistent with the objective of depicting its performance."
""
"Nature of services"
"The Group generally recognizes revenue for analytical services over time as the Group’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls from fixed price"
"contracts and the customers simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as and when the milestones are completed as per the terms of the contract. Revenue on time-"
"and-material contracts are recognised as the related services are performed."
"The Group has adopted the 'as-invoiced' practical expedient for performance obligation satisfied over time with respect to certain fixed price contracts. It permits an entity to"
"recognize revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice the customer if that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance"
"completed to date."
""
"Contract assets and liabilities"
"Contract assets are recognised when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts. Unbilled revenue are classified as contract assets when there is a conditional"
"right to receive cash as per contractual terms."
""
"The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. As a practical expedient, the Group does not assess the existence of a significant financing component"
"when the difference between payment and transfer of deliverables is one year or less."
""
"Contract assets and contract liabilities are reported in a net position on an individual contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Contract assets are classified as current"
"on the balance sheet when the Group expects to complete the related performance obligations and invoice the customers within one year of the balance sheet date, and as long-"
"term when the Group expects to complete the related performance obligations and invoice the customers more than one year out from the balance sheet date. Contract"
"liabilities are classified as current on the balance sheet when the revenue recognition associated with the related customer payments and invoicing is expected to occur within"
"one year of the balance sheet date and as long-term when the revenue recognition associated with the related customer payments and invoicing is expected to occur in more"
"than one year from the balance sheet date."
""
"Contract acquisition/fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except which meet the criteria for capitalisation. The assessment of this criteria requires the"
"application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are"
"expected to be recovered. Applying the practical expedient, the entity recognises the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortisation"
"period of the assets that the entity otherwise would have recognised is one year or less."
""
"The Group records reimbursable out of pocket expenses in both revenue and respective expense head. the goods or services giving rise to the out-of-pocket costs do not"
"transfer a good or service to the customer. Rather, the goods or services are used or consumed by the entity in fulfilling its performance obligation to the customer. Therefore,"
"typical out-of-pocket costs (e.g. travel, meals, lodging) and the reimbursements of such costs from the customer are presented on a gross basis and are included as part of"
"transaction price."
""
""
"Other Income:"
"Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established by the balance sheet date."
"Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the effective interest rate. Interest income is included under the head"

"The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:"
"- the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or"
"- the amortised cost of the financial liability."
"In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the"
"amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the"
"effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis."

"and (3) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset."
"As lessee"
"The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for buildings (office premises). The Group, at the inception of a contract, assesses whether the contract is a lease or"
"not. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a time in exchange for a consideration."
"At the date of commencement of the lease,the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset(“ROU”)and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a"
"lessee,except for leases with a term of twelve months or less(short-term leases) and low value leases.For these short-term and low value leases,the Group recognizes the lease"
"payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease."
"The group elected to use the following practical expedients on initial application:"
"a) Applied a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases of similar assets in similar economic environment with a similar end date."
"b) Applied the exemption not to recognize right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases with less than 12 months of lease term on the date of initial application."
"c) Excluded the initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application."
""
"Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options"
"whenitis reasonably certain that they will be exercised."
"The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the"
"commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives.They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment"
"losses."
"Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. Right of use"
"assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of"
"impairment testing, the recoverable amount(i.e.the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use)is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does"
"not generate cashflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit(CGU) to"
"which the asset belongs."
"The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the"
"lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate."
"Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:"
"- fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments."
"- variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date."
"- amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and"
"- the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to"
"exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early."
"The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in"

"ii)   Deferred tax"
"Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the corresponding"

"SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION"
""
"Client Acquisition and Expansion"
""
"Client relationships are the core of our business. Our ability to grow our business requires both identifying new clients and"
"expanding our breadth of services with existing ones. The process of engaging with new clients and evolving into a thought"
"partner depends on various factors and can present significant challenges. Not every new client will necessarily become a long-"
"term partner. Our solutions allow organizations to transform themselves and define their objectives using data. Such a"
"fundamental shift in how an institution operates can be difficult."
""
"We had an active client base of 45, 47 and 58 clients as of March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our ability to grow"
"our client base and drive market adoption of our solutions is affected by the pace at which organizations digitally transform and"
"their prioritization on data analytics spends compared to legacy spends. We expect that our revenue growth will be primarily"
"driven by the demand for data and analytics services. We believe the degree to which prospective clients recognize the need for"
"our offerings to maximize their business process, would lead to a higher budget allocation by such prospective clients for"
"engaging our services. This will drive our ability to acquire new clients and increase sales to existing clients, which in turn, will"
"affect our future financial performance."
""
"We intend to leverage on the growing data and analytics industry to grow our client base. We have invested, and intend to"
"continue to invest in our sales functions and functional expertise, in order to drive sales to new clients. In particular, we have"
"made, and plan to continue to make, investments to enhance the expertise of our sales and marketing organization within our"
"key focus industries of Technology, BFSI, CPG & Retail, and Industrials."
""
"We typically expand our offerings among our client organizations by cross-selling to multiple business units within these"
"organizations. Our ability to increase sales to existing clients depends on a number of factors, including the size of our technical"
"teams, clients’ level of satisfaction with our services, pricing, economic conditions and our clients’ overall budget and spending"
"levels. Our repeat business has steadily grown and contributed a significant portion of our revenue from contracts with clients"
"over the years indicating a high degree of client loyalty. Our ability to establish and strengthen client relationships and expand"
"the scope of our products and services will be an important factor in our future growth and our ability to continue increasing"
"our profitability."
""
"Growth in the United States market and other markets outside India"
""
"The US market has historically been our single largest market. In Fiscals 2021, 2020 and 2019, our clients located in the United"
"States represented 92.88%, 92.33% and 90.91%, of our revenue from operations, respectively."
"237"
"Our continued business growth and financial performance will depend on our ability to continue to grow our client base in the"
"United States market. The concentration of our revenues from operations from the United States heightens our exposure to"
"adverse developments related to competition, as well as economic, political, regulatory and other changes. Any such adverse"
"development affects the overall economy of the United States may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial"
"condition and results of operations."
""
"Pricing of and margin on our services and revenue mix"
""
"For most of the agreements we enter into with clients, the rates we charge for our professionals are a key factor impacting our"
"gross profit margins and profitability. Rates vary by complexity of the project and the mix of staffing. The margin on our"
"services is impacted by the increase in our costs in providing those services, which is influenced by wage inflation and other"
"factors. As a client relationship matures and deepens, we seek to maximize our revenues and profitability by expanding the"
"scope of services offered to that client and winning higher profit margin assignments."
""
"Recruitment, retention and management of technical workforce"
""
"Our ability to recruit, retain and manage our technical workforce influences our gross profit margin and our results of"
"operations. As of June 30, 2021, we had 729 qualified and skilled personnel in our workforce. We manage employee headcount"
"and utilization based on ongoing assessments of our project pipeline and requirements for industry-specific capabilities and"
"functional expertise. An unanticipated termination of a significant project could cause us to experience lower employee"
"utilization resulting from a higher than expected number of idle professionals. Our ability to effectively utilize our employees"
"is typically improved by longer-term client relationships due to increased predictability of client needs over the course of the"
"relationships."
""
"Our success depends in large part of our ability to attract, retain and train our employees, in particular highly skilled"
"mathematicians and statisticians, and management professionals."
""
"Our employee benefits consists of salaries, wages and bonus, contribution to provident fund and other funds, share based"
"payments, and staff welfare. Salaries and wages in India, including in the services industry, have historically been lower those"
"in the United States, Europe and other developed economies. However, if these costs in India continue to increase at a rate"
"faster than in the United States, Europe and other developed economies due to competitive pressures, we may experience a"
"greater increase in our employee costs, thereby eroding one of our principal cost advantages over competitors in the United"
"States, Europe and other developed economies. In addition, our ability to manage our employee costs will also be heavily"
"impacted by our international and domestic resource mix. For example, any increases in visa fees or healthcare insurance costs"
"for employees located in developed countries such as USA, would increase our employee costs."
""
"In addition, as we continue to invest in the recruitment and retention of sales staff in line with our growth strategies, we are"
"likely to incur costs in relation to our market penetration, sales and marketing initiatives, and for the recruitment of sales"
"employees located in India and overseas."

"SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES"
""
"Basis of preparation"
""
"The Restated Consolidated Statement of Assets and Labilities as at March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019"
"(Proforma) and the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Restated"
"Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the Restated Consolidated Statement of Cash flows for the years ended March"
"31, 2021, March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019 (Proforma), and Summary Statement of Significant Accounting Policies and"
"other explanatory information (together referred to as “Restated Consolidated Financial Information”) has been prepared"
"under Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind AS”) notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and other relevant"
"provisions of the Act as amended from time to time."
""
"Use of estimates and judgments"
""
"In preparing the Restated Consolidated Financial Information, we have made judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect"
"the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may"
"differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting"
"estimates are recognized prospectively."
""
"Judgements"
""
""
"238"
"Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts"
"recognized in the Restated Consolidated Financial Information are included notes therein."
""
"Assumptions and estimation uncertainties"
""
"Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment in"
"the assets and liabilities within the next financial year and are as described in the notes to the Restated Consolidated Financial"
"Information."
""
"Impact on account of COVID-19"
""
"We have considered the possible impact that may arise from COVID-19, a global pandemic, on the carrying amount of our"
"assets including properly, plant and equipment, receivables, investments, other current and non-current assets. In developing"
"the assumptions relating to the impact of possible future uncertainties in global economic conditions because of this pandemic,"
"we, as at the date of approval of these financial statements have used internal and external sources of information including"
"economic forecasts."
""
"Based on current estimates, we expect the carrying amount of the above assets will be recovered, net of provisions established."
"We have also assessed the impact of the situation on our capital and financial resources, profitability, liquidity position, internal"
"financial controls etc., and are of the view that based on present assessment, this situation does not materially impact these"
"standalone financial statements. However, the impact assessment of COVID-19 is a continuing process, given the uncertainties"
"associated with its nature and duration. We will continue to monitor any material changes to future economic conditions."
""
"Measurement of fair values"
""
"A number of our accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial"
"assets and liabilities. We have an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. When measuring"
"the fair value of an asset or a liability, we use observable market data as far as possible. If the inputs used to measure the fair"
"value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorized"
"in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement."
""
"We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change"
"has occurred."
""
"Significant Accounting Policies"
""
"Basis of consolidation"
""
"Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable"
"returns, from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The"
"financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the restated consolidated financial information from the date on which"
"control commences until the date on which control ceases. Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income"
"and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of"
"assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalents. We have identified twelve months as our operating"
"cycle."
""
"Foreign currency transactions"
""
"Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by at their functional currency spot rates at the date of the transaction."
"Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange"
"rate at the reporting date. Exchange differences that arise on settlement of monetary items or on reporting at each balance sheet"
"date are recognized as income or expenses in the period in which they arise. Non-monetary items which are carried at historical"
"cost denominated in a foreign currency are reported using the exchange rates at the date of transaction. Non-monetary assets"
"and liabilities that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of"
"the transaction."
""
"Foreign operations: The assets and liabilities of foreign operations (subsidiaries) including fair value adjustments arising on"
"acquisition, if any, are translated into INR, at the exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign"
"239"
"operations are translated into INR at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions or an average rate if the average rate"
"approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency translation differences are recognised in OCI and"
"accumulated in OCI."
""
"Impairment"
""
"Impairment of financial assets"
""
"We recognize loss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. At each reporting date,"
"we assess whether financial assets carried at amortized cost are credit impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit impaired’ when one"
"or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence"
"that a financial asset is credit impaired includes the following observable data: significant financial difficulty of the borrower"
"or issuer; a breach of contract such as a default or past dues; the restructuring of a loan or advance on terms that we would not"
"consider otherwise; it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; or the disappearance"
"of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties."
""
"We follow a ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables which does not contain a"
"significant financing component. The application of simplified approach does not require us to track changes in credit risk."
"Rather, it recognizes impairment loss allowance based on lifetime impairment pattern at each balance sheet date, right from its"
"initial recognition."
""
"Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. The"
"gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect"
"of recovery. This is generally the case when we determine that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could"
"generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write‑off. However, financial assets that are written off could"
"still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with our procedures for recovery of amounts due."
""
"We measure loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, except for the following, which are measured"
"as 12 month expected credit losses: debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and other"
"debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial"
"instrument) has not increased significantly since initial recognition."
""
"Loss allowances for trade receivables and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit"
"losses. Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected"
"life of a financial instrument. 12-month expected credit losses are the portion of expected credit losses that result from default"
"events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is"
"less than 12 months). In all cases, the maximum period considered when estimating expected credit losses is the maximum"
"contractual period over which we are exposed to credit risk."
""
"When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when"
"estimating expected credit losses, we consider reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without"
"undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on our historical experience"
"and informed credit assessment and including forward looking information."
""
"We consider a financial asset to be in default when: the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to us in full, without"
"recourse to actions such as realizing security (if any is held); or the financial asset is more than past due."
""
"Presentation of allowance for expected credit losses in the balance sheet"
""
"Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets."
""
"Write-off"
""
"The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic"
"prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when we determine that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income"
"that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write off. However, financial assets that are written"
"off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with our procedures for recovery of amounts due."
""
""
"240"
"Impairment of non-financial assets"
""
"Our non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any"
"indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For impairment testing,"
"assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are grouped together into cash-generating units (CGUs). Each CGU"
"represents the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other"
"assets or CGUs. The recoverable amount of a CGU (or an individual asset) is the higher of its value in use and its fair value"
"less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax"
"discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU (or the"
"asset). Our corporate assets (e.g., head office building for providing support to various CGUs) do not generate independent cash"
"inflows. To determine impairment of a corporate asset, recoverable amount is determined for the CGUs to which the corporate"
"asset belongs."
""
"An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount."
"Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Impairment loss recognized in respect of a CGU is allocated"
"first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other"
"assets of the CGU (or group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis."
""
"An impairment loss in respect of assets for which has been recognized in prior periods, we review at each reporting date whether"
"there is any indication that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change"
"in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Such a reversal is made only to the extent that the asset’s carrying"
"amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no"
"impairment loss had been recognized."
""
"Employee benefits"
""
"Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is"
"provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid, if we have a present legal or constructive obligation to"
"pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the amount of obligation can be estimated reliably."
""
"Provident fund. A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions"
"into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. We make specified monthly"
"contributions towards Government administered provident fund scheme. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution"
"plans are recognized as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which the related services are"
"rendered by employees."
""
"Gratuity. Our Company provides for gratuity, a defined benefit plan covering eligible employees. The plan provides payment"
"to vested employees at retirement, death or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s salary"
"and the tenure of employment with the Company. We provide the gratuity benefit through annual contribution to a fund"
"managed by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). Such contributions are determined by LIC based on actuarial"
"valuation using ""projected unit credit method"" as at the balance sheet date."
""
"Re-measurement of the net defined benefit liability with respect to gratuity, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the"
"return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognized in OCI."
"The Company determines the net interest expense / (income) on the net defined benefit liability / (asset) for the period by"
"applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net"
"defined benefit liability / (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability / (asset) during the period"
"as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are"
"recognized in statement of profit and loss."
""
"Compensated Absences. We account for liability towards compensated absences based on actuarial valuation done as at the"
"year-end by an independent actuary using projected unit credit method. Re-measurement gain or losses are recognized in"
"statement of profit or loss in the period in which they arise."
""
"Share based payment. The grant date fair value of equity settled share-based payment awards granted to employees is"
"recognized as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally"
"become entitled to the awards. The amount recognized as expense is based on the estimate of the number of awards for which"
"the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an"
"241"
"expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market vesting conditions at the vesting"
"date."
""
"Revenue"
""
"We are primarily engaged in the business of rendering analytical services. We have revenue from customers. We recognize"
"revenue when we satisfy performance obligations under the terms of our contracts, and control of services is transferred to"
"customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive from customers in exchange for those services. This"
"process involves identifying the customer contract, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the"
"contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue"
"when the performance obligations have been satisfied. A performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations"
"in a contract when it (a) provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are readily"
"available to the customer and (b) is separately identified in the contract."
""
"Taxes assessed by a government authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing"
"transaction, that are collected from a customer, are excluded from sales."
""
"A performance obligation is satisfied over time if one of the following criteria are met: the customer simultaneously receives"
"and consumes the benefits as the entity performs; the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer"
"controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or the entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the"
"entity, and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date."
""
"If control transfers over time, an entity selects a method to measure progress that is consistent with the objective of depicting"
"its performance."
""
"Nature of services"
""
"We generally recognize revenue for analytical services over time as our performance creates or enhances an asset that the"
"customer controls from fixed price contracts and the customers simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as and when"
"the milestones are completed as per the terms of the contract. Revenue on time-and-material contracts are recognized as the"
"related services are performed. We have adopted the 'as-invoiced' practical expedient for performance obligation satisfied over"
"time with respect to certain fixed price contracts. It permits an entity to recognize revenue in the amount to which it has a right"
"to invoice the customer if that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance completed"
"to date."
""
"Contract assets and liabilities"
""
"Contract assets are recognized when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts. Unbilled revenue are classified"
"as contract assets when there is unconditional right to receive cash as per contractual terms. The term between invoicing and"
"when payment is due is not significant. As a practical expedient, we do not assess the existence of a significant financing"
"component when the difference between payment and transfer of deliverables is one year or less."
""
"Contract assets and contract liabilities are reported in a net position on an individual contract basis at the end of each reporting"
"period. Contract assets are classified as current on the balance sheet when we expect to complete the related performance"
"obligations and invoice the customers within one year of the balance sheet date, and as long-term when we expect to complete"
"the related performance obligations and invoice the customers more than one year out from the balance sheet date. Contract"
"liabilities are classified as current on the balance sheet when the revenue recognition associated with the related customer"
"payments and invoicing is expected to occur within one year of the balance sheet date and as long-term when the revenue"
"recognition associated with the related customer payments and invoicing is expected to occur in more than one year from the"
"balance sheet date."
""
"Contract acquisition/ fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except which meet the criteria for capitalization. The"
"assessment of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance"
"resources to be used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered. Applying the"
"practical expedient, the entity recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the"
"amortization period of the assets that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less."
""
""
""
"242"
"We record reimbursable out of pocket expenses in both revenue and respective expense head. The goods or services giving rise"
"to the out-of-pocket costs do not transfer a good or service to the customer. Rather, the goods or services are used or consumed"
"by the entity in fulfilling its performance obligation to the customer. Therefore, typical out-of-pocket costs (e.g. travel, meals,"
"lodging) and the reimbursements of such costs from the customer are presented on a gross basis and are included as part of"
"transaction price."
""
"Government grants. Export benefits in the nature of duty drawback are accounted as income when there is no uncertainty in"
"receiving the same duly considering the realizability."
""
"Other Income. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established by the balance sheet date."
""
"Interest income is recognized on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the applicable interest"
"rate. Interest income is included under the head “other income” in the Statement of Profit and Loss."
""
"The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected"
"life of the financial instrument to: the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or the amortized cost of the financial liability."
""
"In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when"
"the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortized cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-"
"impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized"
"cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross"
"basis."""
""
"Income tax"
""
"Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognized in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates"
"to a business combination or to an item recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income."
""
"Current tax. Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any"
"adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of"
"the tax amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes. It is measured"
"using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities"
"are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts, and it is intended to realize the asset and"
"settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously."
""
"Deferred tax. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and"
"liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax assets are"
"recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred"
"tax assets – unrecognized or recognized, are reviewed at each reporting date and are recognized/ reduced to the extent that it is"
"probable/ no longer probable respectively that the related tax benefit will be realized."
""
"Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is"
"settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. The measurement of deferred"
"tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which we expect, at the reporting date, to recover or"
"settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities."
""
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and"
"they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they"
"intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously."
""
"Minimum alternative tax (MAT) under the provision of Income Tax Act, 1961 is recognised as current tax in the Statement of"
"Profit and Loss. The credit available under the Act in respect of MAT paid is recognised as an asset only when and to the extent"
"there is convincing evidence that the Group would pay normal income tax during the period for which the MAT credit can be"
"carried forward for set-off against the normal tax liability. MAT credit recognised as an asset is reviewed at each balance sheet"
"date and written down to the extent the aforesaid convincing evidence no longer exists."
""
"Cash and cash equivalents"
""
""
"243"
"Cash and Cash equivalents comprise cash, bank balances and bank deposits having original maturity less than three months."
""
"Government Grants"
""
"Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions"
"attaching to them and that the grants will be received. Such grants are valued at fair value at the initial recognition. Government"
"grants are recognized in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company recognizes as expenses the"
"related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. Specifically, government grants whose primary condition is that"
"the Company should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire non-current assets are recognized as deferred income in the"
"balance sheet and transferred to profit or loss on a systematic basis over the useful lives of the related assets."
""
"Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving"
"immediate financial support to the Company with no future related costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which"
"they become receivable."

"There have been no changes in the accounting policies of the Company during the last three financial years, except for with"
"respect to Ind AS 116, which was effective for accounting periods beginning on or after April 1, 2019."
""
"Ind AS 116"
""
"On March 30, 2019, the Ministry of Company Affairs (“MCA”) notified that Ind AS 116 would be effective for accounting"
"periods beginning on or after April 1, 2019, which provides guidelines for the accounting of the lease contracts entered in the"
"capacity of a lessee and a lessor."
""
"We have entered into various operating lease contracts in the capacity of a lessee and lessor and in lines with the accounting"
"principles laid down in Ind AS 116, is required to make the following adjustments:"
""
"•    To recognise a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability in respect of all the operating leases on the"
"transition date."
""
"•    To measure the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The lease"
"payments shall be discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that"
"rate cannot be readily determined, incremental borrowing rate shall be substituted."
""
"•    The lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the payments for the right to use the"
"underlying asset during the lease term that are not paid at the commencement date and includes: (a) fixed payments"

"on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date."
""
"•    The asset recognized in lines with the provisions of Ind AS 116 is required to be depreciated as per Ind AS 16, Property"
"plant and equipment."

"Liquidity Risk"

"are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Our approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that"
